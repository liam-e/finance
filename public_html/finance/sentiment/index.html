<div id="description">
    <p>This website scans Reddit posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" title="r/wallstreetbets">WallStreetBets</a> to track how many times stock tickers are mentioned and the sentiment of the post.
        The website is currently set to collect the newest posts every 15 minutes.</p>
    <p>All frequency is measured by percentage of posts that mention the stock out of all new posts, and is plotted logarithmically.
        A python library called nltk is used to determine the sentiment of posts that mention a stock, and gives number between 1 and -1, with one being very positive and -1 being very negative.
        Neutral sentiment (values between 0.3 and -0.3) are ignored.</p>
    <p>Graphs are updated every 6 hours New Zealand time.
       All times are currently displayed in New Zealand time.</p>
    <p>Some text displayed may be mistaken for stock tickers. Be aware that bots are included in the data.</p>
    <p>The information contained on this website is not intended as, and should not be construed as financial advice.</p>
